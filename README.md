an academic research
This project is developed for academic research.
The User can through this tool convert the academic document among IEEE, ACM, Spring and Elsevier formats.
The tool can reduce the edit task before the thesis or paper's publification.
I know that there are some problems in the tool. I will improve it continuously.
In later, I will convert the project into a Web or webservice, in order to more academic researcher to get this benefit.
